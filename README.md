Turns your degree audit list of requirements into something actually useful.

![example](/art/screenshot.png?raw=true "Example")

## How to use
1. Download courses.py to somewhere on your computer.
2. Replace the first line in courses.py to your copy and pasted list of requirements from the degree audit. Make sure that each requirement is separated by a single space.
3. Open Terminal and make sure you have Python installed (Linux and Mac users have python installed by default).
4. Navigate to where you downloaded courses.py
5. Type "courses.py >> courses".
6. Wait about 5 minutes while it does its thing. DON'T close your terminal. It may seem like it's frozen but it's not!!! This could take a while depending on your internet connection.
7. Once it's completed, open up the new courses file with the file editor of your choice.
